Using Gitlab, BitBucket, SVN, or another SCM? Don’t have a GitHub account but need access to the team’s release notes?

Unfortunately, we don’t support those solutions yet. We’re prioritizing what to support next so if you’d like us to support a different code hosting platform or have team members who don’t have GitHub accounts but want to use Next Release please contact us and let us know.
