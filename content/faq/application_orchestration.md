Hopefully not another three letter acronym we all have to learn ?.  Application Release Orchestration is a subcategory of Developer Operations focused on helping development teams eliminate the hassle of releasing software. Our mission is to make each one of your releases a success, and that starts with removing the time consuming & tedious aspects every release requires. For example versioning your release and generating release notes for it that can be used to communicate to others whatâ€™s changed.
