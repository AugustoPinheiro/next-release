### Automatic Release Notes In GitHub

Next Release automatically generates release notes and changelogs, unlocking knowledge about your team’s work by automatically distributing your application’s changes to sales, support, clients, and more! With only 3 clicks (and an OAuth redirect), your team can start automatically generating release notes that include details of who shipped which features.  Plus, automatically send them to Slack, email, or Word documents. Done and done.
