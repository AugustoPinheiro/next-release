## Share Changes, Keep Moving Forward

It's hard enough planning your current and future work without having to remember what shipped last week, last month, or
last year. Next Release is your zero effort solution to automatically creating release notes and sharing them with your key
stakeholders.

Next Release automatically ships your release notes when you ship code. You can use our built-in Slack integration to
share releases across teams and projects. You can also filter releases for specific groups of projects and generate release notes
in Markdown and Word to share with marketing teams, clients, and executives.
