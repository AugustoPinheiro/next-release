Next Release was so easy to setup and once you set it up, then it's automatic after that. No more having to generate changelogs manually by command line or any other tools. It's just done for you!
This makes my life so much easier to see what's going to be deployed before a deployment happens. It's also nicely organized by sections, such as Features, Improvements, and Bugs. It's made the deployment process a really great experience. Kudos to Next Release!
